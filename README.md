# Trimming_HS_Metagenomics
This repository is made for hosting codes that can be used for trimming the heterogeneity spacers (HS) bases before the primer in a 16s rRNA metagenomics amplicon library. User should modify the Running Script for his/her own project, and that script with call the Perl code. The code searches for a provided primer string, and trims anything before it. The goal is to keep reads that have the premier attached to them, without any HS bases before the primer.
